## Have a private, insightful conversation with a friendly AI – no matter who you are or how you access the web.

## Our goals

- 🔒Privacy First: Your chats are yours alone. We never store data or track your conversations. Period.
- 🦾 Unmatched Accessibility: Whether you're using a screen reader, keyboard navigation, or even the most basic technology, M21.chat adapts to your needs.
- 🌐🌟 Zero Barriers: We're built with inclusivity at the core. No fancy tech required – just a browser and your curiosity.
- 👂Always Evolving: We're constantly improving accessibility with the help of our community. Got feedback? We're all ears!

## Additional Considerations for Accessibility

- ARIA Landmarks: Use clear ARIA landmarks to help screen readers navigate the interface efficiently.
- ⌨️ Keyboard Support: Ensure all interactive elements can be accessed and used with a keyboard.
- 🌓 High-Contrast Mode: Provide a high-contrast mode for users with visual impairments.
- Alternative Text: Include meaningful alternative text for any non-text content.

## Notes on the Tech Stack

- NextJS: A great framework for both performance and developer experience.
- Tailwind: CSS framework that adds flexibility without sacrificing accessibility.
- Ant.design: A well-regarded component library. Ensure accessibility features are carefully reviewed and implemented.

## Help wanted 🤝
